Project Description:
This project is a basic Calculator Application developed using Android Studio and Java. The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project involves designing the user interface using XML and implementing logic for handling input and performing operations using Java. Additionally, special edge cases, such as division by zero, were addressed to ensure a smooth user experience.

Features:
* Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Dynamic display updates for user input and results.
* Error handling for edge cases, such as division by zero.
* Intuitive and responsive user interface designed in XML.
* Optimized for smooth user experience with clean code and efficient calculations.

Technologies That Were Used:
* Android Studio for project setup, UI design, and deployment.
* Java for handling business logic, input management, and calculator operations.
* XML for designing the user interface (UI).

How to Install/ Prerequisites:
* Android Studio
* Java SDK configured
  
Installation Steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files
2. Open Android Studio and select "Open an Existing Project"
3. Navigate to the project directory and open it
4. Gradle sync
5. run the application

How to Use the Project:
1. Input numbers by pressing the number buttons on the interface.
2. Choose an operation (+, -, *, /) to perform.
3. Press the equals (=) button to get the result.
4. Use the C (clear) button to reset the input and result.
5. The app will handle invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero) and display appropriate error messages.
